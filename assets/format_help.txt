How to create your own formatted output:

1. Create a new file, with the '.frm' extention


2. Insert your custom format syntax

Example: '  .byte ${$data}, ${$data}, ${$data}, ${$data}  ; Character ${$char} | {char} \n', excluding '
Output:	 '  .byte $45, $3E, $F0, $3C  ; Character $08 | 8\n' 	(of course '\n' will be a new line indicator)

	{$data} = Counting Data in Hex Format		Example: 45, 3E, F0, 3C
	{data} = Counting Data in Decimal Format	Example: 69, 62, 240, 60
 
	{$char} = Index as Hex format			Example: 08, 09, 0A, 0B
	{char} = Index as Decimal format		Example: 8, 9, 10, 11

	The Rest will be left unchanged, only replacing shown format markers.
	You only need to write a single line, since the pattern repeats until Index reaches end.


3. Save at a custom location, or in the assets folder, found in the applications run path


4. Automatic Install:
		Open format manager, under 'Export > Manage Custom Formats'
		Add / Remove the format file.
		Click "save", and thats it!

   Manual Install:
		Copy the .frm file, to the assets folder, in the applications run path
		edit "custom_format.txt" and add / delete the file.
		Just insert the Filename without path >> "custom.frm"

		It's important, that every filename be written in it's own line!

		Restart the application, and you're good to go!
