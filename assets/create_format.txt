How to create your own Format File:

1. Create a File, with the ".frm" extention, but any other will work just fine

2. Write the Syntax

   The Syntax is just one Line. You can mix Text and Insert Indicators.

Example:
	'    .byte ${$data}, ${$data}, ${$data}, ${$data}  ; Character ${$char} | {char} \n', exclusing '

The Output will be for example:
	'    .byte $45, $3E, $F0, $3C  ; Character $08 | 8\n'

	Insert Indicators are:

	{data}	=> Data in Decimal format
	{char}  => Character number
	\n	=> New Line
	\t	=> Tab (4 spaces)

	You can put $ or b infront of the text to indicate a format change
	{$data} will be converted to Hexadecimal and
	{bdata}, to binary

	The File is finished, when the Data Index Counter reaches 
	256 (in 8x8 mode) or 512 (8x16 mode)
